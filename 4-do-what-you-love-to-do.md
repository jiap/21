# 4. 做你热爱做的事
> Do What You Love to Do

*当你开始做你真正热爱做的事情后，你不会在生命中的其他时间做这件事。— BRIAN TRACY* 

>  When you start doing what you really love to do, you’ll never work another day in your life. — BRIAN TRACY

Doing what you love to do is one of the great secrets of financial success. One of your primary responsibilities in life is to find out what you really enjoy doing, what you have a natural talent for, and then to throw your whole heart into doing that particular work very, very well. 

做你热爱的事是取得经济成功的秘密之一。你生活中最基础的责任是找到你真正热爱的事、与生俱来的事，以及将你全身心投入到这份特殊的工作中去。

Self-made millionaires are those who have found a field where their natural strengths and abilities are exactly what is required to do the job and achieve the results desired. Most self-made millionaires say that they *“never worked a day in their life.”* You must find a field in which you can be totally absorbed a job or area of endeavor that completely fascinates you, that holds your attention, that is a natural expression of your special talents and abilities. 

自我造就的百万富翁是那些找到了他们与生俱来力量和能力投入到需要工作并获得渴望结果的一群人。绝大多数自我造就的百万富翁说他们“从未在生命的其他时间做”。你必须找到一个领域，在那里你能全情投入一份工作或领域，在那里能吸引你，保持你的注意力，是你特殊天性的和能力的自然流露。

When you are doing what you love to do, you seem to have a continuous flow of excitement, en- ergy, and ideas to do what you do even better. Here is a question for you: **If you won a million dollars, tax free, tomorrow, would you continue to do what you are currently doing?** 

当你开始做你热爱的事，你似乎有持续不断的热情、能量和想法去做的更好。有个问题：如果你明天有百万美元，免税的，你还会持续做你现在做的事情吗？

This is a great question. It simply asks you what you would do if you had all the time and money you needed and you were free to choose your occupation. Self-made millionaires, if they won a million dollars cash, would continue doing what they are doing. They would only do it differently or better or at a higher level. But they love their work so much that they wouldn’t even think of leaving it or retiring. 

这是个大问题。这是个当你有了你需要的时间和金钱，你可以自由选择职业，你会做什么的问题。当他们赢得百万美元现金，自我造就的百万富翁会继续做他们正在做的事情。他们可能会有点忙区别或做的更好。但是他们如此热爱他们的工作，以至于他们从没想过离开或者退休。

Perhaps the greatest responsibility of adult life, when you are surrounded by so many different choices of occupation and career, is for you to find out what you really love doing and then dedicate yourself to that field. And no one else can do this for you. 
可能成人生活中最大的责任是，当你被不同的职业和工作选择围绕，对你而言找到你真正热爱做的事以及将自己奉献给找个领域。没人能替你做。
