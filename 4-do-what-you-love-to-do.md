# 4. 做你热爱做的事
> Do What You Love to Do

*当你开始做你真正热爱做的事情后，你生活中将不再有工作了。— BRIAN TRACY* 

>  When you start doing what you really love to do, you’ll never work another day in your life. — BRIAN TRACY

做你热爱做的事是取得财务成功的秘诀之一。你人生中最主要的责任之一就是找到你真正热爱做的事、与生俱来想做的事，然后全身心投入到那份特别的工作中去。
> Doing what you love to do is one of the great secrets of financial success. One of your primary responsibilities in life is to find out what you really enjoy doing, what you have a natural talent for, and then to throw your whole heart into doing that particular work very, very well. 

白手起家的百万富翁是那些已经找到某个领域的人，在这个领域里，他们与生俱来的优势和能力正是从事这项工作并达到预期结果所需要的。大多数白手起家的百万富翁说他们“一生从未工作过一天”。你必须找能让你全情投入其中的领域，一个能让你完全着迷、吸引你的注意力的工作或领域，这是你特殊才能的和能力的自然表达。
> Self-made millionaires are those who have found a field where their natural strengths and abilities are exactly what is required to do the job and achieve the results desired. Most self-made millionaires say that they *“never worked a day in their life.”* You must find a field in which you can be totally absorbed a job or area of endeavor that completely fascinates you, that holds your attention, that is a natural expression of your special talents and abilities. 

当开始做你热爱做的事情后，你似乎有源源不断的热情、精力和想法把事情做的更好。有个问题：**如果你明天赢得百万美元，免税，你还会继续做你现在做的事情吗？**
> When you are doing what you love to do, you seem to have a continuous flow of excitement, energy, and ideas to do what you do even better. Here is a question for you: **If you won a million dollars, tax free, tomorrow, would you continue to do what you are currently doing?** 

这是个很好的问题。这是问你，如果有了你需要所有的时间和金钱并且可以自由选择职业，你会做什么的问题。如果白手起家的百万富翁赢得百万美元现金，他们会继续做他们正在做的事情。他们只会以不同或更高或更高地方式做到这一点。但他们如此热爱他们的工作，以至于他们从未想过离开或退休。
> This is a great question. It simply asks you what you would do if you had all the time and money you needed and you were free to choose your occupation.  millionaires, if they won a million dollars cash, would continue doing what they are doing. They would only do it differently or better or at a higher level. But they love their work so much that they wouldn’t even think of leaving it or retiring. 

可能成人生活中最大的责任是，在你被众多不同的职业和工作选择围绕，找到你真正热爱做的事，然后将自己奉献给这个领域。没人能为你做到这一点。
> Perhaps the greatest responsibility of adult life, when you are surrounded by so many different choices of occupation and career, is for you to find out what you really love doing and then dedicate yourself to that field. And no one else can do this for you.
