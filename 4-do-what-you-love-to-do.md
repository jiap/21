**4. Do What You Love to Do** 

When you start doing what you really love to do, you’ll never work another day in your life. 

—BRIAN TRACY 

DOING WHAT YOU love to do is one of the great secrets of financial success. One of your primary responsibil- ities in life is to find out what you really enjoy doing, what you have a natural talent for, and then to throw your whole heart into doing that particular work very, very well. 

Self-made millionaires are those who have found a field where their natural strengths and abilities are ex- actly what is required to do the job and achieve the re- sults desired. Most self-made millionaires say that they *“never worked a day in their life.”* You must find a field in which you can be totally absorbed—a job or area of endeavor that completely fascinates you, that holds your attention, that is a natural expression of your special talents and abilities. 

When you are doing what you love to do, you seem to have a continuous flow of excitement, en- ergy, and ideas to do what you do even better. Here is a question for you: If you won a million dollars, tax free, tomorrow, would you continue to do what you are currently doing? 

This is a great question. It simply asks you what you would do if you had all the time and money you needed and you were free to choose your occupation. Self-made millionaires, if they won a million dollars cash, would continue doing what they are doing. They would only do it differently or better or at a higher level. But they love their work so much that they wouldn’t even think of leaving it or retiring. 

Perhaps the greatest responsibility of adult life, when you are surrounded by so many different choices of occupation and career, is for you to find out what you really love doing and then dedicate yourself to that field. And no one else can do this for you. 

==ACTION EXERCISE==

*Identify the type of work that you enjoy the most. What activities have been most responsible for your success in life to date? If you could do any job at all and be successful at it, what would you choose? Set it as a goal, make a plan, and begin moving in that direction today.*
