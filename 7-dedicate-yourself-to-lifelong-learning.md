**Dedicate Yourself to Lifelong Learning** 

Continuous learning is the minimum requirement for success in any field. 

—DENIS WAITLEY 

YOU HAVE A virtually unlimited capacity to learn and improve in your chosen field. You have more brains, ability, and intelligence than you could ever use if you were to work on developing yourself for the rest of your life. You are smarter than you can even imagine. There is no obstacle that you cannot overcome, no problem you cannot solve, and no goal you cannot achieve by applying the power of your mind to your situation. 

But your mind is like a muscle. It develops only with use. Just as you have to strain your physical muscles to build them, you have to work your mental muscles to build your mind as well. The good news is that the more you learn, the more you can learn. Just like the more you play a sport, the better you get at the sport. The more you dedicate yourself to lifelong learning, the easier it is for you to learn even more. 

Leaders are learners. Continuous learning is the key to the 21st century. Lifelong learning is the minimum requirement for success in your field or in any field. Make a decision today that you are going to be- come a student of your craft and that you are going to continue learning and becoming better for the rest of your life. 

There are three keys to lifelong learning. The first key is to read in your field for at least 30 to 60 minutes each day. **Reading is to the mind as exercise is to the body.** Reading for an hour each day will translate into about one book per week. One book per week will translate into 50 books per year. Fifty books per year will translate into 500 books over the next 10 years. 

Since the average adult reads less than one book per year, when you begin reading one hour per day, one book per week, this alone will give you an in- credible edge in your field. You will become one of the smartest, most competent, and highest paid people in your profession by simply reading one hour each day. 

The second key to lifelong learning is to listen to audio programs in your car as you drive from place to place. The average person sits behind the wheel in his or her car 500 to 1,000 hours per year. This is the equivalent of 12 to 24 forty-hour weeks, or as much as three to six months of working time that you spend in your car. This is the equivalent of one to two full-time semesters at a university. 

Turn your car into a *learning machine,* into a university on wheels. Never let your car motor be run- ning without an educational audio program playing. Many people have become millionaires through the miracle of audio learning. This is why audio learning is often called the greatest breakthrough in education since the invention of the printing press. 

A third key to lifelong learning is to attend every course and seminar you can possibly find that can help you to be better in your field.* The combination of books, audio programs, and seminars will enable you to save hundreds of hours and thousands of dol- lars, and many years of hard work, in achieving the level of financial success that you desire. 

Make a decision today to become a lifelong learner. You will be amazed at the effect that it has in your ca- reer. Lifelong learning can be a major factor in your becoming a self-made millionaire.
