# 5. 致力于卓越
> Commit to Excellence

你的生活质量取决于你追求卓越的决心有多深，无论你选择的是什么领域。— VINCE LOMBARDI 
> The quality of your life will be determined by the depth of your commitment to excellence, no matter what your chosen field. — VINCE LOMBARDI

今天就下定决心把所做的事做到最好。为自己设定一个目标——让自己进入你所在行业的前10%，无论是什么。这个让自己非常非常擅长工作的决定，会变成你人生中的转折点。实际上，所有成功的人都被认为是在他们所选的领域非常胜任的。
> Resolve today to be the very best at what you do. Set a goal for yourself to join the top 10 percent of your field, whatever it is. This decision, to become very, very good at what you do, can be the turning point in your life. Virtually all successful people are recognized as being extremely competent in their chosen fields. 

记住，没有人比你更好，也没有人比你更聪明。现在在前 10% 的人是从倒数 10% 开始的。每个做的好的人曾经也做的很差。每个在他 (她) 领域处于顶峰的人也曾经在另一个领域工作。无数他人已经做过的事，你也可以做到。
> Remember that no one is better than you, and no one is smarter than you. And everyone who is in the top 10 percent today started off in the bottom 10 percent. Everyone who is doing well was once doing poorly. Everyone who is at the top of his or her field was at one time in another field altogether. And what countless others have done, you can do as well. 

这有个成功的重要规则：*当你变得更好时，你的生活才会变的更好*。既然你能变多好是没有上限的，那你能让你的生活变得多好也没有上限。
> Here is a great rule for success: *Your life only gets better when you get better.* And since there is no limit to how much better you can become, there is no limit to how much better you can make your life. 

你决定在你所做的事情上做到卓越，进入所在领域的前10%，这是你人生中的转折点。这是取得巨大成功的关键。这也是高度自尊、自我尊重和个人自豪感的基础。在你真的擅长你所做的事情，你会对自己感到很棒。优秀会影响你的整个性格以及你和他人的关系。当你知道自己是这个领域的佼佼者，你感到快到和自豪。
> Your decision to become excellent at what you do, to join the top 10 percent in your field, is the turning point in your life. It is the key to great success. It is also the foundation of high levels of self-esteem, self-respect, and personal pride. When you are really good at what you do, you feel wonderful about yourself. Being excellent affects your whole personality and all your relationships with other people. You feel happy and proud when you know you are at the top of your field. 

在你职业生涯中，有一个你会问和回答的重要问题：**“如果我成长并以一种卓越的方式做到了这一点，有什么技能会对我的人生产生最积极的影响？”**
> Here is one of the most important questions you will ever ask and answer, for the rest of your career: **What one skill, if I developed and did it in an excel- lent fashion, would have the greatest positive impact on my life?** 

你不可能立即把每件事做好，但你可以找到一个最能帮助你的技能，然后全身心地投入发展这个技能。设立一个目标，写下来，设置截止时间，制定计划，并每天在该领域变得更好。你绝对会对这种追求卓越的态度给你生活带来的改变感到震惊。这一决心会让在职业生涯中成为白手起家的百万富翁。
> You cannot become good at everything right away, but you can identify the one skill that can help you the most and then throw your whole heart into develop- ing that skill. Set it as a goal. Write it down. Set a deadline. Make a plan. And work on becoming better in that area every single day. You will be absolutely amazed at the difference this commitment to excellence will make in your life. This commitment alone can make you a self-made millionaire in the course of your career.
