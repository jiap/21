# 3. 把自己视作自我雇佣
> See Yourself as Self-Employed 

我是我灵魂的统帅；我是我命运的主宰。—— WILLIAM HENLEY [1]
> I am the captain of my soul; I am the master of my fate.  — WILLIAM HENLEY 

从现在开始，对你现在和将来的一切都承担完全的、100%的责任。拒绝为自己的问题或缺点而责怪他人。停止抱怨你生活中不开心的事情。不要因为任何事而批评其他人。对自己负责。如果在你生命中有你不喜欢的东西，那就由你来改变它。你说了算。
> From now on, accept complete, 100 percent responsibility for everything you are and everything you will ever be. Refuse to make excuses or to blame other people for your problems or shortcomings. Stop complaining about things in your life that you are not happy about. Refuse to criticize other people for any- thing. You are responsible. If there is something in your life that you don’t like, it is up to you to change it. You are in charge. 

最富有的 3% 的美国人把自己视为自我雇佣的，无论谁在他们的薪水上签字。你能犯的最大错误是认为你为他人工作，而不是为自己。你总是自我雇佣的。无论你此刻在哪工作，你都是自己私人服务公司的总裁。
> The top 3 percent of Americans see themselves as self-employed, no matter who signs their paychecks. The biggest mistake you can ever make is to think that you work for anyone other than yourself. You are always self-employed. You are always the president of your own personal service corporation, no matter where you might be working at the moment. 

当你把自己视为自我雇佣后，你就培养出“企业家”心态，即高度独立、自我负责和自我启动个体的心态。较之“等待”事情发生，你会“让”事情发生。你认为自己是自己生命的主宰。你认为自己完全掌控你的身体健康、经济财务、实业、人际关系、生活方式、家庭、汽车以及你生活中的其他一切。这就是白手起家的百万富翁的思维方式。
> When you see yourself as self-employed, you develop an *entrepreneur* mentality, the mentality of highly independent, self-responsible, self-starting individuals. Instead of *waiting* for things to happen, you *make* things happen. You see yourself as the boss of your own life. You see yourself as completely in charge of your physical health, your financial well-being, your career, your relationships, your lifestyle, your home, your car, and every other element of your existence. This is the mind-set of the self-made millionaire. 

自我负责的人是强烈结果导向的。他们总是很主动。他们主动参与任务，并且总是要求承担更多的责任。因此，他们成为组织中最有价值和最受尊敬的人。他们不断地为将来需要更高权威和责任的职位做准备。你也应该这么做。
> Self-responsible people are intensely result oriented. They always take high levels of initiative. They volunteer for assignments and are always asking for more responsibility. As a result, they become the most valuable and respected people in their organizations. They continually prepare themselves for positions of higher authority and responsibility in the future. You should do the same. 

有个问题：**如果某天你担任公司总裁，或对你的工作结果负全责，你会立即施行哪一项变更？**
> Here’s a question: **If you were president of your company for a day or were completely responsible for results where you work, what one change would you enact immediately?** 

无论是什么，写下来，指定计划，今天就开始执行。仅此一项行动就能改变你的生活。
> Whatever it is, write it down, make a plan, and begin implementing it today. This action alone could change your life.
