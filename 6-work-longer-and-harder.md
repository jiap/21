# 6. 工作长久且努力
> Work Longer and Harder

*越努力工作，越幸运 —— JAMES THURBER*

> The harder I work, the luckier I get. — JAMES THURBER 

所有白手起家的百万富翁都努力、勤奋地工作。他们开始地很早，努力工作并呆到很晚。他们在他们的领域里梳理了最勤奋工作的名声。所有人都知道。
> All self-made millionaires work hard, hard, hard. They start earlier, they work harder, and they stay later. They develop a reputation for being amongst the hardest working people in their fields. And everybody knows it. 

练习 “40+” 公式。这个公式说的是，每周工作 40 小时是为了生存，超过 40 小时的一切是为了成功。如果你只工作 40 个小时（现在每周的平均工作时长接近 35 小时），你所做的事是为了生存。你永远不会领先。你永远不会在财务上取得巨大的成功。你永远不会受到同事高度尊重和敬佩。每周 40 小时的基本工作让你永远平庸。
> Practice the “40 Plus” formula. This formula says that you work 40 hours per week for survival; everything over 40 hours is for success. If you work only 40 hours (and the average workweek today is closer to 35 hours), all you will ever do is survive. You will never get ahead. You will never be a big financial success. You will never be highly respected and esteemed by your colleagues. You will always be mediocre working the basic 40-hour week. 

但是，40小时之后的每个小时都是对你未来的投资。事实上，通过观察你每周花在 40 小时以上的时间，你能非常准确地预测出五年后你会在哪里。没有什么能和长时间的辛苦工作替代。
> But every hour over 40 hours is an investment in your future. In fact, you can tell with tremendous accuracy where you are going to be in five years by looking at how many hours over 40 you put in every week. There is just no substitute for long days and hard work. 

在美国，白手起家的百万富翁平均每周工作 59 小时，他们中的许多人工作 70 或 80 小时，尤其是在他们职业的早期。他们平均每周工作六天，而不是五天，而且工作时间也更长。如果你想打电话给白手起家的百万富翁，在正常工作时间之前或之后给办公室打电话吧。白手起家的百万富翁在那些朝九晚五的员工来的时候就在那，员工离开时，他们仍在那。
> Self-made millionaires in America work an average of 59 hours per week. Many of them work 70 or 80 hours, especially at the start of their careers. They work an average of six days per week, rather than five, and work longer days as well. If you want to call a self-made millionaire, phone the office before normal working hours and after normal working hours. The self-made millionaire is there when the staff, the “nine-to-fivers,” arrive and is still there when they leave. 

这里有个关键点：在你工作时间全身心工作。当你工作时，不要浪费时间。当你早到时，马上低头开始工作。当人们想要与你闲聊，找个借口说，“我得回去工作了。”
> And here’s the key: Work all the time you work. When you work, don’t waste time. When you get in early, put your head down and get started immediately. When people want to talk to you, excuse yourself and say, “I have to get back to work!” 

不要丢弃你干洗衣服、给你朋友打电话，与同事保持联系或者读报纸的习惯。在你工作时间全身心工作。今天就下定决心成为公司工作最努力的人。这将引起那些能够比几乎所有其他事情更快地帮助你的人的注意。
> Do not drop off your dry cleaning, phone your friends, socialize with your coworkers, or read the newspaper. Work all the time you work. Resolve today to develop the reputation for being the hardest working person in your company. This will bring you to the attention of people who can help you faster than almost anything else you can do. 

**行动训练**
> ACTION EXERCISE 

今天就制定一个计划，增加你每天工作的时间。下定决心提前一小时来办公室，有一个领先的开始。当其他人都不在的时候，在午餐时间工作。多呆一小时以便赶上进度。仅此策略会使你的输出翻倍，同时每天只增加两个小时。
> Make a plan today to increase the number of hours you work each day. Resolve to get to the office one hour earlier and get a head start on the day. Work at lunchtime when others are gone. Stay one hour later to get caught up. This strategy alone will double your output while adding only two hours to your day.
