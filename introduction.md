Introduction: The Law of Cause and Effect

What you are about to learn can change your life. These ideas, insights, and strategies have been the springboards to financial success for millions of men and women, young and old, rich and poor. These principles are simple, effective, and fairly easy to apply. They have been tested and proven over and over again, and they will work for you if you will take them and apply them in your own life.

We are living at the greatest time in all of human history. More people are becoming wealthy today, starting from nothing, than ever before imagined. There are more than seven million millionaires in America, most of them self-made, and the number is growing by 15 to 20 percent each year. We even have self-made ten millionaires, hundred millionaires, and more than two hundred billionaires. We have never seen this type of rapid wealth creation in all of human history.

Here’s the best news of all. Virtually everyone starts with nothing. More than 90 percent of all finan- cially successful people today started off broke or nearly broke. The average self-made millionaire has been bankrupt or nearly bankrupt 3.2 times. Most wealthy people failed many times before they finally found the right opportunity that they were able to leverage into financial success. And what hundreds of thousands and millions of other people have done, you can do as well.

The iron law of human destiny is the Law of Cause and Effect. This law is simple yet very powerful. It says that there is a specific effect for every cause. For every action, there is a reaction. This law says that success is not an accident. Financial success is the re- sult of doing certain, specific things over and over again until you achieve the financial independence that you desire.

Nature is neutral. The natural world, the market- place, or our society does not care who you are or what you are. The Law of Cause and Effect says that if you do what other successful people do, you will even- tually get the results that other successful people get.

And if you don’t, you won’t. This law says that when you learn the success secrets of self-made mil- lionaires and apply them in your own life, you will ex- perience results and rewards far beyond anything you have accomplished up until now.

Here is an important point for you to remember. **Nobody is better than you and nobody is smarter than you**. Let me repeat that. **Nobody is better than you and nobody is smarter than you.** Get those thoughts out of your mind. One of the primary reasons for selling yourself short, for underachievement and lack of financial success, is the conviction that people who are *doing* better than you are better than you. This is simply not the case.

The fact is that most self-made millionaires are ordinary people with average educations working at average jobs and living in average neighborhoods in average houses driving average cars. But they have found out what other financially successful people do and they have done those same things over and over again until they achieved the same results. It is no miracle and it is no accident. And when you think the same thoughts and do the same things that self-made millionaires do, you will begin to get the same results and benefits they do. It is simply a matter of cause and effect.

There are 21 success secrets of self-made million- aires. Each of these is indispensable to your becoming financially independent. The failure to apply any one of these principles can, by itself, undermine and even destroy your chances for health, happiness, and great prosperity.

The good news is that you can learn every one of these principles by practice and repetition, over and over again, until they become as natural to you as breathing in and breathing out. Just as you learned to ride a bicycle or drive a car, you can learn the success secrets of self-made millionaires and apply them in your life. And there are no limits except the limits you place on yourself by your own thinking. Now, let us begin.
